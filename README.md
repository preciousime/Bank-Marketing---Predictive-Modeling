# Predictive-Modeling for Bank Marketing

This project involved developing an effective telemarketing strategy to sell term deposit accounts for a Portuguese bank in collaboration with two data analysts. This bank has been conducting marketing campaigns, but it has not been effective. If the dataset provided by the bank is a correct the representation of their data, then it proves that their telemarketing strategy is not effective because only 12% of the customers are subscribed to their term deposit accounts.

The dataset consisted of 4521 rows and 17 attributes – 7 of which were quantitative and 10 which were qualitative including the target attribute. The dataset was prepared using R. The dataset had no missing data, but it contained a lot of outliers, and it was imbalanced.

The two machine learning methods were used in this analysis – Decision Tree and Naïve Bayes. These methods were used for all attributes and the selected attributes (Age, Duration, and Poutcome). The Decision Tree was created using Python and SAS, while the Naïve Bayes method was applied using Python. The performance metrics – accuracy, recall, and precision – were used to evaluate the accuracy of the models. The Decision Tree 
Sklearn is the best model in accurately predicting the customers who subscribed to the term deposit.

We would recommend that the bank should contact customers who are in their 40’s or above, in management or a technician, married, with minimum secondary school education, and with account balance above £1600 as they are most likely to subscribe to a term deposit account.
